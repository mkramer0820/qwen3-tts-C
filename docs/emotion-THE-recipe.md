## How a user invokes it
**One flag.** `--emotion <sad|joy|anger|fear|disgust|surprise>` (1.7B CustomVoice only). The engine auto-applies
the table below (expr + steer + a default English instruct + temperature). A vivid **English** `--instruct` and an
explicit `-T` always override. `--emotion` is a **1.7B** flag: on the 0.6B it is a no-op (gated on
`hidden_size >= 2048`) — the legacy `.vec` control-vector path was retired 2026-07-09.

> 🔹 **The 0.6B is NOT emotion-less — it just works differently.** On the small model emotion is not an
> inference-time lever but a **property of the voice**: you clone from emotional audio and get an emotional
> voice (4 KB asset, works for presets and clones, composes with `[tag]` paralinguistics, RTF ≈ 0.78 under
> `--int8`). That recipe lives in **[`emotion-06b-recipe.md`](emotion-06b-recipe.md)** — do not apply the
> steer/expr/COMBINE recipe below to the 0.6B, it silently does nothing.

```bash
./qwen_tts -d qwen3-tts-1.7b -s ryan -l Italian --emotion sad --text "…" -o out.wav
```

## The recipe — ONE rule (ear-validated 2026-06-29, full per-language sweep)

**Pure STEER wins everywhere** — clean timbre, no noise, emotes in every language. So:

- **PRESET voice → STEER**: `presets/steer/emotion/ryan_<emo>.qlsteer` @ `--ml-range 21-25`, **`--ml-weight 12`**
  (w10 also good), `--ml-decay 0.985`, **no expr, no instruct**. The ryan CLEAN palette is used for ALL voices
  (it transfers cross-voice/cross-language).
- **CLONE voice → COMBINE**: the language `.expr` @1.0 (renders/stabilizes a cross-language clone) **+** STEER @ w12
  **+** a default English instruct. The one easy clone recipe.

**weight:** anger & fear are best at **w12**; the rest win at w10 *or* w12 → **w12 is the single default**.
(Earlier per-(voice×emotion) EXPR/COMBINE tables are SUPERSEDED — pure STEER at w12 beat them with the right speaker.)

**Use the NATIVE preset per language** (the engine applies STEER to *whatever* voice you pass, but the GOLD
voice is the language-native one; the router prints a hint):

| language | native preset | language | native preset |
|---|---|---|---|
| Japanese | **ono_anna** | Italian / English / Portuguese | **ryan** |
| Korean | **sohee** | German / French / Spanish | **vivian** (ryan also good for Romance) |
| Chinese | **vivian** / uncle_fu | (cloned voice, any language) | the clone → COMBINE |

Notes:
- `--instruct` (vivid English) and `--expr` are **optional manual overrides** on a preset — not in the default.
  COMBINE (expr+steer) gave anger/fear a "touch of class" in some languages but **broke Spanish (noise)** → it's
  the clone default, not the preset default.
- seed 42 is the reference. Temperature 1.1.

## Blended emotions (dyads) — the shelf composes (2026-07-08)
Emotion steering **directions ADD**: a 50/50 sum of two primary `ryan_<emo>.qlsteer` vectors renders a coherent
NEW emotion (ear-validated ryan EN+IT, `samples/tests/2026-07-08_emotion-dyads/`). Seven ship as first-class
`--emotion` values — no new capture, no FT:

| dyad | blend | mix |
|---|---|---|
| `contempt`    | anger + disgust  | 50/50 |
| `awe`         | fear + surprise  | 50/50 |
| `nostalgia`   | joy + sad        | **40/60** (sad-lean; 50/50 read too light in EN) |
| `disapproval` | surprise + sad   | 50/50 |
| `remorse`     | sad + disgust    | 50/50 |
| `outrage`     | anger + surprise | 50/50 |
| `despair`     | fear + sad       | 50/50 |

Built with `tools/steer/dyad_mix.py OUT A.qlsteer:0.5 B.qlsteer:0.5` → `presets/steer/emotion/ryan_<dyad>.qlsteer`.
Same STEER recipe as the primaries (preset @ w12 L21-25). **Insight:** `joy`-paired blends over-drive on long EN
carriers — mind the ratio; the others compose cleanly at 50/50.

## Inline `[emotion]` switching — per-sentence, one generation
Write `[emotion]` tags inside `--text` (any primary or dyad) and the engine switches emotion **span-by-span in a
single generation**, in the voice's own timbre, clean at the seams (ear-validated 2026-07-08). `[neutral]`/`[none]`
resets. Same qlsteer STEER recipe as `--emotion`, applied per sentence (compose path, `qwen_emotion_steer_install`
saves/restores the global steer per span). Also works in the HTTP server. The old `.vec` per-span palette is retired.
```
./qwen_tts -d qwen3-tts-1.7b -s ryan -l English -T 1.1 --text \
  "[contempt] Oh, sure, that's a brilliant idea. [nostalgia] We used to spend every summer by the sea. [despair] And now there's nothing left." -o switch.wav

## Assets
- expr packs (`presets/expr/`): `italian_csp_topk6`, `german_csp_k6`, `french_csp_k6` (shipped on HF, fetch with
  `bash download_assets.sh`). Native `{german,french,spanish}_r32` re-exportable from the GPU box checkpoints
  (`reference_gpu_ft_checkpoints`) — NOT shipped (k6 won for DE/FR).
- steer vectors (`presets/steer/emotion/ryan_*.qlsteer`): committed in git.

## Russian
Native preset = **ryan** (not vivian — vivian sits too high-pitched on Russian, ear-verdict 2026-06-30).

## Emotion + paralinguistics (`[laugh]`/`[sigh]`/… inside an emotional line) — experimental
`--emotion` composes with an inline paralinguistic `[tag]` in `--text`. **Only when a para event tag is present**
the emotion switches to the validated **para+emo setup** (it does NOT change the pure-emotion path above):
- **force COMBINE** even on a preset STEER cell — the per-language `.expr` is the language-correction that stops
  the EN-captured para anchor (`ahahah`/`haaah`) from drifting the accent (without it: language drift + metallic).
- **emotion steer** at the cell weight (w12) + a default English instruct.
- **para steering vector** (`presets/steer/paraling/{laugh_vs_cry,sigh_vs_laugh}.qlsteer`, L21-25) at its
  **per-voice** weight: **ryan w6** (most sensitive — w8 goes metallic/derails), **galatea/vivian w8**.

Engine: `compose_from_text` + `text_has_para_event()` + `para_active` in `main.c` (the per-span loop preserves
the global emotion steer/expr on spoken spans; each `[tag]` span swaps in its para vector). `[laugh]`/`[sigh]` use
the steering vector; `[huff]`/`[ugh]`/`[hmm]`/`[mmm]`/`[phew]`/… are soft onomatopoeia macros.

> ⚠️ **STILL UNSTABLE (TODO, plan_emo_v3) — much better than before, but not solid across all langs/voices.**
> Clearest on `[laugh]`/`[sigh]` with `ryan`/`vivian`. Known rough edge: on a CLONE the laugh span (a separate
> cold-prefill span) can sound slightly detached/off-timbre (the seam, not audio-splice). Provenance of the
> per-voice weights + the "anchor + vector" rule: memory `project_paralinguistic_steering_vector` (ear 2026-06-25/28).

## Instruct control (strength & speed) — the `--instruct` lever
`--instruct` (1.7B, COMBINE/clone path only — preset pure-STEER needs none) is a secondary flavour on top of the
recipe. Two things it CAN do: (1) **strength** — a vivid free-form instruct pushes emotion; `strong` is the default,
`very-strong` pushes further (anger raspier); (2) **speed** — plain English `"speak faster/slower"` shifts pacing
(~±15%), pitch-up a little. What it CANNOT do: a **slot template** (`Tempo:+15%/Pitch:higher`) — Qwen doesn't parse
it (`Tempo:+40%` comes out *slower*). Full findings + the per-emotion strong/very-strong instruct library:
**`docs/emotion-instruct-control.md`**.

## Try it
- `make emotion-demo` (Italian ×6 + multilingual + galatea clone) → `samples/tests/emotion_demo/`.
- `make emotion-para-demo` (emotion + inline `[tag]` across langs/speakers) → `samples/tests/emotion_para_demo/`.
