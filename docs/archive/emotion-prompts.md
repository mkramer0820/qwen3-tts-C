# Emotion instruct-prompt library

A reusable bank of **English instruct prompts** for expressive TTS, organized by family.
Taxonomy inspired by the Dawizzer ComfyUI emotion node (75 presets); the *prompts* are ours
because on this engine the working emotion lever is **`--instruct` in English**, not sampling
knobs (those only add arousal — see `docs/emotion-THE-recipe.md`).

## The recipe (what actually works)

```bash
./qwen_tts -d qwen3-tts-1.7b -s ryan -l Italian \
  --instruct "<vivid English instruction from below>" \
  -T 1.1 --seed 42 --text "<your text>" -o out.wav
```

- **Preset voice** (`-s ryan`) follows instruct strongest. **Cloned voice — DEFAULT**: load an
  8 KB **x-vector `.bin`** with `--xvector-only` (`--load-voice voices/X.bin --xvector-only`) at
  **T1.3** — it keeps identity without the reference recording's room reverb, so it's cleaner and
  has more force headroom. Make the `.bin` with `python3 tests/qvoice_to_xvec.py voices/X.qvoice`.
  *Alternative*: load a `.qvoice` with `--icl-only` (the ICL graft) for max timbre mimicry from a
  clean ref — emotion works but is capped at *moderate* (no screaming/sobbing). See
  [`docs/csp-ft-emotion.md`](../csp-ft-emotion.md) and
  [`docs/icl-graft-portability.md`](../icl-graft-portability.md).
- **English instruct even for non-English speech** — the model's instruct-following is EN/ZH-centric.
- **Temperature 1.1–1.3** (never `-T 0` = flat). **Seed-audition**: re-run with several `--seed`
  values and keep the best take — spontaneous paralinguistics (sighs, "ehhh…") emerge on *some* seeds.
- Keep the spoken **text emotionally neutral** when you want the *instruct* (not the words) to carry
  the emotion, so it reads cleanly.

> **Compose / blend tip:** for nuance, layer two compatible directions in one instruct
> (e.g. "*bitter and exhausted*", "*nervous but trying to sound confident*"). Unlike the
> sampling-knob averaging (which cancels), an instruct can hold a genuine semantic blend.
