# HTTP Server

The built-in HTTP server loads the model once at startup and keeps weights in memory
across requests. The tokenizer is cached after the first call, so subsequent requests
skip all loading overhead and go straight to inference.

> **Serving many users at once?** Add `--batch-size N` to step concurrent requests
> **together** through the model (vLLM-style request batching: weights read once,
> continuous scheduling, per-request streaming). See
> [server-batching.md](server-batching.md). This page covers the single-request server.

## Starting the Server

```bash
# Basic — preset voices
./qwen_tts -d qwen3-tts-0.6b --serve 8080

# With a custom voice preloaded — DEFAULT: 8 KB x-vector .bin (clean, no room reverb)
./qwen_tts -d qwen3-tts-0.6b --load-voice voices/mario.bin --xvector-only --serve 8080

# ALTERNATIVE: ICL .qvoice graft at startup, for max timbre mimicry
./qwen_tts -d qwen3-tts-0.6b --load-voice voices/mario.qvoice --icl-only --serve 8080

# With INT8 quantization (1.7B)
./qwen_tts -d qwen3-tts-1.7b --int8 --serve 8080
```

Cloning is set **at server start** via `--load-voice` (per-request bodies are preset-only —
there is no per-request clone field). The recommended default is the 8 KB **x-vector `.bin`**
with `--xvector-only`: it carries identity without the reference recording's room reverb, so it
stays clean across requests. Make it with `python3 tests/qvoice_to_xvec.py voices/X.qvoice`. The
ICL `.qvoice` with `--icl-only` also works at startup (preloading WDELTA weight deltas if present)
for maximum timbre mimicry. The voice language is preserved from the voice metadata across all
requests — clients don't need to specify language or speaker.

## Endpoints

### `POST /v1/tts` — Generate full WAV

Returns a complete WAV file (24 kHz, 16-bit PCM, mono).

```bash
# Minimal — defaults to speaker=ryan, language=English
curl -s http://localhost:8080/v1/tts \
  -d '{"text":"Hello, how are you today?"}' -o output.wav

# With explicit options
curl -s http://localhost:8080/v1/tts \
  -d '{"text":"Ciao, come stai?","speaker":"vivian","language":"Italian"}' \
  -o ciao.wav

# With style control (1.7B model only)
curl -s http://localhost:8080/v1/tts \
  -d '{"text":"I cannot believe it!","instruct":"Speak angrily"}' \
  -o angry.wav

# With emotion — installs the 1.7B qlsteer vector used by CLI --emotion.
curl -s http://localhost:8080/v1/tts \
  -d '{"text":"What a wonderful day!","speaker":"ryan","language":"English","emotion":"joy"}' \
  -o joy.wav

# Per-sentence DYNAMIC emotion — inline [mood] tags switch emotion mid-text within ONE request.
# The server auto-detects markup, synthesizes each span with its own emotion and concatenates.
# Same tag set as the CLI: [joy] [sad] [excited] [proud] [calm] [angry] … + [neutral], [pause:400ms],
# and paralinguistics [laugh]/[sigh]. Works on /v1/tts (full) and /v1/tts/stream (span-by-span).
curl -s http://localhost:8080/v1/tts \
  -d '{"text":"[joy] What wonderful news! [sad] But I have to go now. [pause:400ms] [calm] Take care.","speaker":"ryan","language":"English"}' \
  -o dynamic.wav
```

### `POST /v1/tts/stream` — Streaming PCM

Returns chunked raw PCM (s16le, 24 kHz, mono) as it generates.
First audio arrives within ~1 second.

```bash
# macOS — real-time playback via ffplay
curl -sN http://localhost:8080/v1/tts/stream \
  -d '{"text":"Hello, how are you today?"}' | \
  ffplay -f s16le -ar 24000 -ac 1 -nodisp -autoexit -

# macOS — real-time playback via sox
curl -sN http://localhost:8080/v1/tts/stream \
  -d '{"text":"Hello, how are you today?"}' | \
  play -t raw -r 24000 -e signed -b 16 -c 1 -

# Linux — real-time playback via aplay
curl -sN http://localhost:8080/v1/tts/stream \
  -d '{"text":"Hello, how are you today?"}' | \
  aplay -f S16_LE -r 24000 -c 1

# Save raw PCM to file, then convert
curl -sN http://localhost:8080/v1/tts/stream \
  -d '{"text":"Hello"}' -o output.raw
ffmpeg -f s16le -ar 24000 -ac 1 -i output.raw output.wav
```

### `POST /v1/audio/speech` — OpenAI-Compatible

Drop-in replacement for the OpenAI TTS API. Maps `input` to text, `voice` to speaker.

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8080/v1/audio/speech \
  -d '{"input":"Hello world","voice":"ryan"}' -o output.wav
```

### `GET /v1/speakers` — List Available Speakers

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8080/v1/speakers | python3 -m json.tool
```

### `GET /v1/health` — Health Check

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8080/v1/health
```

## Request Body

```json
{
  "text": "Hello world",
  "speaker": "ryan",
  "language": "English",
  "instruct": "Speak cheerfully",
  "emotion": "joy",
  "volume": 1.0,
  "rate": 1.0,
  "seed": 42,
  "temperature": 0.5,
  "top_k": 50,
  "top_p": 1.0,
  "rep_penalty": 1.05
}
```

All fields except `text` are optional. Defaults: speaker=ryan, language=English,
temperature=0.5, top_k=50, top_p=1.0, rep_penalty=1.05, seed=random.

**Expressivity fields:**

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `instruct` | Free-form style prompt (**1.7B only**), e.g. `"Speak angrily"`. |
| `emotion` | Named mood routed to the 1.7B qlsteer palette (applied during generation, so it works on **both** `/v1/tts` and `/v1/tts/stream`). For a cloned voice, start the server with the appropriate `--expr <language.expr>` to match the CLI COMBINE recipe; without it, HTTP emotion is STEER-only and the server logs a note. |
| `volume` | Linear output gain (`1.0` = unchanged). Overrides the emotion recipe's volume; applied on both full and streaming paths. |
| `rate` | Pitch-preserving tempo (`>1` faster). Overrides the emotion recipe's rate. Applied on `/v1/tts`; **not** on `/v1/tts/stream` (needs the full buffer). |
| inline `[mood]` markup (in `text`) | **Per-sentence dynamic emotion.** If the `text` carries inline tags — `[joy]`/`[sad]`/`[excited]`/… to switch mood mid-text, `[neutral]` to reset, `[pause:400ms]`/`[break:1s]` for gaps, `[laugh]`/`[sigh]` paralinguistics — the server splits the text into spans, synthesizes each with its own emotion, and concatenates them. Auto-detected on **both** endpoints; `/v1/tts/stream` flushes span-by-span (low time-to-first-audio). This is the same composer as the CLI's `--compose` / auto-detected `--text`. The top-level `emotion` field sets a single mood for the whole request; inline tags let one request span several. Same tag set as [docs/markup.md](markup.md). |

Each request resets its **sampling parameters** to defaults (speaker, language, temperature,
top-k/p, rep-penalty, seed) **and clears any prior emotion steering**, so nothing leaks between requests.

> **Reproducibility (fixed 2026-06-03):** identical consecutive requests now produce **bit-identical**
> output, and a cold server request matches the CLI. The earlier cross-request divergence was a stale
> `ctx->dec_x` left over on a full-prefix match; the fix forces a fresh prefill in that case (the
> partial-match delta-prefill optimization is preserved). Regression-guarded by `make test-serve-repro`
> (3 identical requests, bit-identical) and `make test-serve-concurrent` (per-worker clones, corr=1.0).

## Performance

Benchmarked on Apple M1 8-core, 16 GB RAM, 4 threads, same text + seed (`--seed 42`). bf16 below;
**with `--int8` the 0.6B server is faster than real-time warm — RTF ~0.88** (and ~0.93 with a cloned
`.qvoice`). See [performance.md](performance.md) for the full int8 sweet-spot table.

| 0.6B, bf16 | Short text (~8s audio) | Long text (~16s audio) |
|---|---|---|
| **First call** (cold) | 12.2s → RTF 1.50 | 20.0s → RTF 1.28 |
| **Warm call** | 11.3s → RTF 1.39 | 19.7s → **RTF 1.26** |
| **Warm call, `--int8`** | **RTF ~0.88** ⚡ | even lower |

The first request pays a one-time cost for tokenizer parsing (~200ms) and warming the
OS page cache for mmap'd weights. Warm calls benefit from:

- **Cached tokenizer** — parsed once, reused across requests
- **Resident weight pages** — mmap'd BF16 weights stay in RAM
- **Pre-allocated buffers** — zero malloc in decode loop
- **LRU text embedding cache** — ~8MB for 2048 tokens, skip 2 matvec per cached token
- **Decoder thread overlap** — speech decoder runs in background during generation

### Custom Voice Server Performance

RTF with `.qvoice` loaded (Apple M1, 4 threads, Italian, seed 42):

| Mode | 0.6B RTF | 1.7B RTF |
|------|----------|----------|
| CLI | 1.48 | — |
| Server (warm) | **1.44** | 3.32 |
| Server stream | **1.48** | 3.18 |
| Server (cold) | 2.01 | 3.57 |

Custom voices have **no meaningful RTF penalty** compared to preset voices.

## Testing

```bash
make test-serve          # Health, speakers, TTS integration test
make test-serve-bench    # 2 runs, same seed, verify bit-identical output
make test-serve-openai   # OpenAI-compatible /v1/audio/speech endpoint
make test-serve-parallel # 2 concurrent requests, verify both complete
make test-serve-all      # Run all server tests
make serve               # Start server on port 8080
